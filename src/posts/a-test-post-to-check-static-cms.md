Manual scavenging refers to the practice where individuals have to manually clean and dispose of human excreta, without any protective gear or equipment. This inhumane practice is a violation of basic human rights and puts the lives of these workers at risk. It is a degrading and dangerous job that is often done by marginalized communities, and it is essential that we work towards eradicating this practice for good. Governments and individuals alike need to take responsibility and work towards providing alternative livelihoods and safe sanitation practices to eliminate the need for manual scavenging.
